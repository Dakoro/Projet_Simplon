\\u2208 T U the type of man M (w).Then, G contains edges {\\u03b1, \\u03b2 \\u2032 } and {\\u03b1 \\u2032 , \\u03b2} and as {m, w} blocks M it holds \\u03b2 \\u227b \\u03b1 \\u03b2 \\u2032 and \\u03b1 \\u227b \\u03b2 \\u03b1 \\u2032 .Thus, G was rejected, a contradiction.Further, as M is of weight at least It remains to argue why the algorithm always finds a solution if one exists.Let M 2 be a stable matching in P 2 with |M 1 \\u25b3M 2 | \\u2264 k.Let M be the matching M 2 where we match all agents that are unmatched in M 2 to agents from the dummy types.Further, let G \\u2032 be the graph

have been rejected because of types \\u03b1 \\u2032 \\u2208 T U and \\u03b2 \\u2032 \\u2208 T W , then agents of these types form a blocking pair for M , a contradiction.Moreover, matching M is

In the first case, v being external to S increases the count of external neighbors, leading to k i + 1 > k i and maintaining 0 reachability.In case 2) both u and v belong to S, therefore the count of internal neighbors is increased by 1.This yields k i -1 \\u2265 0, since the exclusion of the case V i = V implies k i \\u2265 1. Extending to the case where k i agents external to V i are connected to u, we observe that, at worst case, S contains all k i external agents, yielding k i -k i \\u2265 0. Any set of k i additions is independent of each other, thus not affecting the reachability of the agents in V i with respect to each other.Additionally, for any agent v belonging to a different community G[V j\\u0338 =i ], the same reasoning applies from v's perspective, in this way proving the robustness property.See Fig. 3 for a graphic representation the two cases.\\n\\nAs was shown by Selten [16], the perfect equilibria of a game's strategic and extensive forms need not coincide.However he showed that an equivalence relationship holds between the equilibria of any extensive game and its associated agent normal form [16].This is because the agent normal form of any game views each node of the game tree, of the extensive form of the game, as a player in the game.As a consequence each player represents an information set held by the player and will have an identical pay-off function to the player.\\n\\nAssume that the algorithm returns yes because we found a matching M .Let M 2 be the matching M restricted to all agents which are not of one of the two dummy types.We first prove that M 2 is always stable.As dummy types appear only at the end of the preferences of each agent, it is sufficient to argue that M is stable.Assume for the sake of contradiction that the returned matching M is blocked by {m, w}, where m \\u2208 A \\u03b1 and w \\u2208 A \\u03b2 for some \\u03b1 \\u2208 T U and \\u03b2 \\u2208 T W .Let \\u03b2 \\u2032 \\u2208 T W be the type of woman M (m) and \\u03b1 \\u2032 \\u2208 T U the type of man M (w).Then, G contains edges {\\u03b1, \\u03b2 \\u2032 } and {\\u03b1 \\u2032 , \\u03b2} and as {m, w} blocks M it holds \\u03b2 \\u227b \\u03b1 \\u03b2 \\u2032 and \\u03b1 \\u227b \\u03b2 \\u03b1 \\u2032 .Thus, G was rejected, a contradiction.Further, as M is of weight at least It remains to argue why the algorithm always finds a solution if one exists.Let M 2 be a stable matching in P 2 with |M 1 \\u25b3M 2 | \\u2264 k.Let M be the matching M 2 where we match all agents that are unmatched in M 2 to agents from the dummy types.Further, let G \\u2032 be the graph on T U \\u222a \\u2022 T W where \\u03b1 \\u2208 T U and \\u03b2 \\u2208 T W are connected if and only if an agent of type \\u03b1 is matched to an agent of type \\u03b2 in M .If the graph G would have been rejected because of types \\u03b1 \\u2032 \\u2208 T U and \\u03b2 \\u2032 \\u2208 T W , then agents of these types form a blocking pair for M , a contradiction.Moreover, matching M is clearly a perfect matching of weight at least\\n\\nWe should also point out that the selected subset of games depends both on the original complete set of games and also the set of algorithms studied.Having a different set of agents could mean different games, that might previously have been too hard, would suddenly be more discriminatory.Similarly, adding additional games can affect which games provide us with redundant information.Because of this, while the specific games identified here are interesting today, they might very well change in the future.It is therefore meaningless to ask for the \\\"true\\\" set of most discriminatory games, as that will always be relative to the agents available.However, we believe the more important contribution of this paper is the methodology we propose to select these games.\\n\\nQuestion: What are near-perfect agents in the game of ConnectFour and how do they differ from each other?\\nHelpful Answer:\"]", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "{\"generations\": [[{\"text\": \" Near-perfect agents in ConnectFour are agents that use alpha-beta search to make near-perfect moves in the game.
